                <p>The benefits of using Ajaxy include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>No page refreshes. The user doesn't need to wait for an entire page to reload, and for all the elements to be rendered.</li>
                    <li>Allows for a more <strong>fluid user experience</strong>. You have control over what happens between requests.</li>
                    <li>The user is never left with a blank white screen, as they might be when navigating in the conventional way.</li>
                    <li>Allows you to address connection issues within the comfort of your template. The user isn't faced with a horrible browser message. For example, if their connection goes dead while on your website, and if they try to access a new page, you can simply show them a message.</li>
                    <li>Fully bookmarkable + back-button support. Using Ajaxy does not diminish usability whatsoever; I've made every effort to make this as accessible and usable as an Ajax integration-solution can be!</li>
                    <li>Ajaxy is very flexible. It will work in most situations. If, for example, you need to re-initiate event handlers within a replaced area, Ajaxy provides a way to do that via function callbacks. Although, I recommend you use jQuery's <code>live()</code> for most event handling.</li>
