> One of the greatest things about
> jQuery is the ever-expanding userbase.
> In the past it was common for
> libraries to have a small following,
> with only a handful of plugins and
> widgets made by advocates of the
> library. Now it seems everyone has
> their own jQuery plugin. You only have
> to look on Github to see many
> programmers have thrown their
> two-cents into the jQuery community.
> It seems you have the dabblers who
> make small plugins to test their
> skill, and (usually) end-up creating
> something truely awesome, and the
> aficionados who only do jQuery stuff
> (and only very rarely throw out good
> code, though some do).
> 
> Over the past three or so years I have
> been assimilating and trying to make
> sense of the sheer volume of these
> plugins, and over the course of my
> constant checking of del.icio.us, and
> various other javascript related
> sites, I came up with a jQuery project
> of my own. I couldn't help it, I had
> to respond to this phenomenon. You
> see, I collect jQuery plugins that I
> find interesting, and if time permits,
> use them extensively in my projects.
> It turns out, I only like good jQuery
> plugins, that is, plugins which bring
> something new to the table, or offer a
> unique way of interacting with a
> website that hasn't been done before.
> 
> Sadly, some plugin authors don't get
> the exposure they deserve for their
> work, as usually references to a
> particular plugin are drowned by the
> noise of the dreaded 'link list' /
> 'roundup' type post. Hands up how many
> people discovered a plugin they really
> liked by wading through a huge list on
> some blog? (*Puts hands up*). If the
> web-as-app needs better
> discover-ability techniques, then
> surely we must get rid of bloated
> content farms serving up the 'coolest
> jquery plugins of 2011' type posts,
> and actually create something a bit
> more human and above all, of high
> quality.
> 
> This is a 'handpicked' repository of
> jQuery scripts, so don't be offended
> when you see a script you don't like.
> If you're annoyed certain plugins
> didn't make the list, create your own
> repo! I've even made the entire site's
> source code available so you can do
> just that.
